### What's the status of your company?

### Where are you based?

Our team is distributed between New York, Guadalajara, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, and Wellington.

### Can I see your company budget?

We run our company via [an Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/search?q=open%20collective) ourselves. You can also see the [Collective for the Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource). We still have some work to do to be even more transparent, and we hope to continue improving in this area.

### How much investment have you raised?

We try to be very transparent about our own finances. We raised a total of $2,815,000 so far \($815k on convertible notes in 2015-2016, $2M Series Seed in June 2017\).
