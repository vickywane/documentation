# Contributing

First, thank you for considering contributing to Open Collective! It's people like you that make this such a great community. We welcome any type of contribution, not only code.

Check out our [Roadmap](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/roadmap) for the latest priorities.

You can help with:

* **QA**: file [bug reports](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues), the more details you can give the better
* **Internationalization**: [translate the interface](https://crowdin.com/project/opencollective)
* **Documentation**:[ suggest edits](../#how-to-contribute-to-these-docs) to this documentation
* **Marketing**: writing blog posts and share success stories
* **Design**: help Collectives make a logo or a background image
* **Code**: there are always plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/issues)! We also have [Bounties](https://github.com/opencollective/documentation/tree/7991781321e21c71705dddaf37775eeb78dbe972/developers/bounties.md).
* **Feature ideas**: [raise an issue](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/) with your suggestion
* **Peer Support**: answer questions [on our Slack](https://opencollective.slack.com)

## Code Contributions

Unsure where to begin contributing to Open Collective? You can start by looking through the \[good first issues\]\([https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue)"\), which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

**General guidelines**

* The strings must be internationalized. See [/help/developers/translations](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/translations)
* Whenever it's possible we must use `styled-components` to write styles. See [OC Styleguide](https://opencollective-styleguide.now.sh/)
* Icons must be imported from the [styled-icons](http://styled-icons.js.org/) library.
* Tests written with Cypress must follow our [good practices](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/testing-with-cypress) conventions.

### Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests into smaller chunks. If it's a bug fix, it will probably be quickly merged and deployed. If it's a new feature, it will need more testing and review.
