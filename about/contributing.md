# Contributing

First, thank you for considering contributing to Open Collective! It's people like you that make this such a great community. We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. 

You can help with:

* **QA**: file [bug reports](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues), the more details you can give the better
* **Internationalization**: [translate the interface](https://crowdin.com/project/opencollective)
* **Documentation**:[ suggest edits](../#how-to-contribute-to-these-docs) to this documentation
* **Marketing**: writing blog posts and share success stories
* **Design**: help Collectives make a logo or a background image
* **Code**: there are always plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/issues)! We also have [Bounties](../developers/bounties.md).
* **Feature ideas**: [raise an issue](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/) with your suggestion
* **Peer Support**: answer questions [on our Slack](https://opencollective.slack.com)

## Code Contributions

Unsure where to begin contributing to Open Collective? You can start by looking through the [good first issues](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue"), which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

Want to get paid for contributing code? Check out our [bounty program](../developers/bounties.md).

### Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests into smaller chunks. If it's a bug fix, it will probably be quickly merged and deployed. If it's a new feature, it will need more testing and review.

**If you have any questions, reach out to us on** [**Slack**](https://slack.opencollective.com)**.**
