# Values

**Sustainability**: We can’t achieve our mission unless we are sustainable doing it. We take a broad definition of sustainability as financial, collective and individual sustainability.

**Openness:** We work in the open, use public slack, our code is public. We strive to be reachable and welcoming.

**Resilience \(people come and go\)** A successful company survives its founders. We try to do things in a way anyone can pick up after and carry on.
