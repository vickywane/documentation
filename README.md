## Overall FAQ

_See links for more details. Each chapter heading in the docs has its own more specific FAQ._

### What’s an Open Collective?

An [Open Collective](product/product.md) is a place for communities to collect and disburse money transparently.

### Who is Open Collective for?

Open Collective is great for collaborative groups, like meetups, open source projects, [and more](collectives/collectives.md#what-is-open-collective-good-for)—and for the [those](financial-contributors/financial-contributors.md) who want to support them.

### How is it different from other platforms?

[Open Collective is different.](product/comparison.md) It's fully transparent \(you can see where money comes from and where it goes\), and designed for ongoing communities, not individual creators or one-off campaigns.

### How much does it cost?

[Pricing](about/pricing.md) is based on a small percentage of funds raised through the platform, 5%-10% depending on your [Fiscal Host](fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md).

### Does it work in my country?

People can contribute from anywhere by credit card, with donations denominated in the [currency](product/currencies.md) of the Fiscal Host. Payouts work everywhere our payment providers, Stripe and PayPal, serve.

### Can I get a receipt for my donations?

Yes! One main purpose of Open Collective is to provide unincorporated projects the legal and financial structures to provide [people](financial-contributors/financial-contributors.md) receipts and invoices.
