# Creating a Collective

Open Collective allows you to create a transparent funding page for your project in just a few clicks. No need to incorporate, hire a lawyer and accountant, or define organizational roles.

You can create an Open Collective for free right now at [**https://www.opencollective.com/create**](https://www.opencollective.com/create)\*\*\*\*

Once your Collective is created, go to "[edit Collective](customize-collective.md)" to personalize your page and and write a detailed description. Setting up a Collective is a great opportunity to clarify your mission and explain why people should back you. 

In order to receive or spend money, you'll need to [add a fiscal host](add-or-change-fiscal-host.md).
