# Resources for documentarians

## How can I contribute to these docs?

### Addressing issues related to documentation

Read [all issues labeled `documentation`](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation) on opencollective/opencollective or [all issues on opencollective/documentation](https://github.com/opencollective/documentation/issues) and pick one to work on!

### Checking if a page needs to be updated

As of November of 2019, a release notes tool is in the works. While it doesn't get ready, your best resource for checking if something has changed on Open Collective is reading [the recently closed issues](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) on the opencollective/opencollective repository and checking if something needs to updated!

### Reviewing the current documentation

Did you find a typo, a broken link or image? Do you think that something could be explained better? Feel free to [edit pages and submit a pull request](suggesting-changes.md)!

## Screen capture

### Firefox Screenshots

Firefox offers [a built-in tool](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-screenshots) that can either capture a portion of the page or the whole page you're current in.

### Flameshot

[Flameshot](https://flameshot.js.org) is an open-source software that helps you take screenshots easily and edit them as soon as you take them.

### Peek

[Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) is an open-source software that allows you to record portions of your screen and easily transform them into GIF, APNG,  MP4, or WebM.

## Extensions

### GoodTwitter

[GoodTwitter](https://github.com/ZusorCode/GoodTwitter) is an open-source extension to revert your current Twitter user interface to the old one. As of November of 2019, Twitter has unveiled their new interface and the embedding code they now offer don't work as intended on GitBook. To be able to embed tweets as seen on the [Sustainer Resources](../../financial-contributors/organizations/sustainer-resources.md) page, you will need to access the old UI.

GoodTwitter is available for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodtwitter/jbanhionoclikdjnjlcmefiofgjimgca) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodtwitter/).
