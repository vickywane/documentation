# Design Workflow

## Mapping our process

The process to open-up the design collective is based on a specific concept**:**

**Clarity and transparency in the design process.**

In order to achieve this common ground, the design collective has created a **consensual** **map of an ideal design process.** One that could adapt to different project sizes and complexities, well understood by designers and non-designers alike.

### What does it serve a process map for?

* Open-up the design production process
* Produce efficiently
* Maintain brand cohesion
* Make sure each individual is working on projects that come to fruition
* Help adjacent collectives or teams like product management, marketing and engineering know exactly how to work with design

### Ideal sprint cycle

The following diagram describes the ideal workflow of a sprint of 10 working days, all the way from planning the sprint to the demo day where the series of design solutions are presented with a public release.
