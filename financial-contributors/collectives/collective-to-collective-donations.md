# Collective to Collective donations

If you have a Collective with funds in its balance, you may use that as a payment method when contributing to another Collective within the same [Fiscal Host](https://github.com/opencollective/documentation/tree/7991781321e21c71705dddaf37775eeb78dbe972/financial-contributors/hosts/README.md). There are no fees for this method of donating.

We are working on the functionality to enable Collectives to give directly to Collective in a different host. As a workaround for now, the Collective you want to give to can submit an expense for your donation.

To donate using your Collective balance, simply make a contribution and select it as your payment method during checkout.
