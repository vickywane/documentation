## What is an Organization?

An Organization is a profile that represents a a legal entity instead of an individual. Companies that become Financial Contributors, as well as legal entities that are Fiscal Hosts, are all Organizations on Open Collective.

## Why Create an Organization?

* Have your company show up as a Financial Contributor of Collectives
* Enable your employees to support Collectives on behalf of your company
* Make [bulk transfers](bulk-transfers.md) so you can send money once and distribute it to Collectives as you wish
* Create a profile to host \(become a Fiscal Host\) for a project. [Read more about Fiscal Hosts](../../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md)
