# Currencies

## Collectives can receive contributions from all over the world via credit card, in any currency.

Donation amounts will be denominated in the currency of the Collective's [Fiscal Host](../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md), which can be set up in the following currencies \(so far\):

* USD
* EUR
* CAD
* MXN
* GBP
* AUD

**The currency a Fiscal Host supports is determined by the currency used by their Stripe account.** If you would like to set up a Fiscal Host in a different currency, please contact us at **support@opencollective.com**.
