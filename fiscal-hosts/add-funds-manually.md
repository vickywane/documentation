# Add Funds Manually

{% hint style="warning" %}
[In January of 2020](https://blog.opencollective.com/new-host-plans), we introduced new paid plans for Fiscal Hosts. Adding funds received through other channels is **free up to $1000 across Collectives** for Fiscal Hosts ****on the **Starter** plan. After you've reached that limit, you will need to upgrade your plan.
{% endhint %}

You can manually add funds to a Collective directly. This is useful when you receive a donation for a Collective outside the Open Collective system \(like a bank transfer\) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget.

Log in and go to your [Fiscal Host dashboard](fiscal-host-dashboard.md). Use the search bar to find the Collective you want to add funds for and click on **Add Funds**.

Clicking on **Add Funds** should direct you to this form:
